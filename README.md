# NBA-ref-analysis

The code and data in this repository were used in the paper ``Implicit Biases in Refereeing: Lessons from NBA Referees``. 

The script ``main.R`` invokes the rest of the scripts each one of which performs the analysis for the different parts of the paper. 

The script ``pIDs_boxscore.py`` is a helper script that collects the boxscore data and NBA player IDs.
